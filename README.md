#  Snake {Python Game}
This Python game is a Snake game. The player controls a snake that must eat food to grow longer and avoid hitting the wall or its own tail. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own tail.

The game is implemented using the following classes:

    •	Snake: This class represents the snake. It has a list of segments, which are Turtle objects. The snake's head is the first segment in the list.
    •	Food: This class represents the food. It is a Turtle object with a blue color and a circular shape.
    •	Scoreboard: This class represents the scoreboard. It is a Turtle object that displays the current score.

The main game loop is implemented in the main.py file. The game loop does the following:

    1. 	Updates the screen.
    2.	Moves the snake.
    3.	Checks for collisions between the snake and the food, the wall, and its own tail.
    4.	Updates the scoreboard.

The game is started by running the main.py file. The player can control the snake using the arrow keys. To move the snake up, press the Up arrow key. To move the snake down, press the Down arrow key. To move the snake left, press the Left arrow key. To move the snake right, press the Right arrow key.

## Tech Stack
The following technologies were used in the creation of the Snake game you provided:
    1. Python: Python is a general-purpose programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is a popular choice for developing games because of its simplicity and flexibility.
    2. Turtle: Turtle is a Python library that provides a simple way to draw graphics on the screen. It is used in the Snake game to draw the snake, the food, and the scoreboard.
    3. Random: The random library is used to generate random positions for the food.

In addition to these technologies, the Snake game also uses the following standard Python modules:

    1. Time: The time module is used to control the speed of the game loop.
    2. Screen: The Screen module is used to create and manage the game window.
    
The Snake game is a simple example of how Python can be used to create games. With Python and the Turtle library, you can create a variety of different games, from simple arcade games to complex role-playing games.

## Documentation
Here are some documentation resources for the technologies mentioned above:

    •	Python: Python official documentation: https://docs.python.org/ 
    
    •	Turtle: Turtle documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html 
    
    •	Random: Random documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html 
    
    •	Time: Time documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html 
    
    •	Screen: Screen documentation: https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html

The Python official documentation is a comprehensive resource for learning about Python. It covers all aspects of the language, from basic syntax to advanced topics such as object-oriented programming and concurrency.

The Turtle documentation provides a detailed overview of the Turtle library. It explains how to use the library to draw different shapes and patterns on the screen.

## Lessons Learned
Building a Snake game can teach you a number of lessons about programming and game development, including:

    • Object-oriented programming: The Snake game is a good example of how to use object-oriented programming concepts to develop a game. The Snake, Food, and Scoreboard classes represent different entities in the game, and each class has its own unique properties and behaviors. 
    • Game loop: The Snake game uses a game loop to control the flow of the game. The game loop updates the game state, renders the game world, and checks for user input. 
    • Collision detection: The Snake game uses collision detection to determine if the snake has collided with the food, the wall, or its own tail. 
    • User input handling: The Snake game uses user input handling to allow the player to control the snake.

In addition to these general programming and game development lessons, building a Snake game can also teach you specific skills such as:

    • Using the Turtle library: The Snake game uses the Turtle library to draw graphics on the screen. Learning how to use the Turtle library can be useful for developing other types of games, such as arcade games and simulations. 
    • Generating random numbers: The Snake game uses the random library to generate random positions for the food. Learning how to generate random numbers can be useful for developing other types of games, such as role-playing games and strategy games.

Overall, building a Snake game is a great way to learn about programming and game development concepts. It is a fun and challenging project that can be completed by programmers of all skill levels.
